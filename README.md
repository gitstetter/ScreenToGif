# ScreenToGif

Aloha out there,

I made this little tool to record your screen and save the result in GIF Format.

It's not rocket science, but hey "a gif says more than million words".

Thanks to [Algorithmen verstehen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCswWBF6ZkGnLG3sLRR65xRw "Check this out") for the inspiration!

in case you wonder, how to convert this python file into an exe:

Cheers,
